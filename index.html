            <h1>Amateur Video Production</h1>
            <p id="p1"> Amateur film production in Norh of Slovakia has started in years 90ties it was 8mm film and
              nowadays has
              amateur film production expanded to production mady by smartphone so anyone can make movies and easly.
              Mostly everbody have quit good camera by the hand in his smartphone. But how you can use it??? You can
              learn in this website and here you can check other amateurs videos also.

        <p class="history-paragraph">
          History of video production began with motion pictures which were based on the illusion of persistence of
          vision and the
          phi phenomenon. Earlier before photography was invented, optical toys were used. They were mounted on
          successive phase
          drawings to create the motion pictures.A home movie is a short amateur film or video typically made just to
          preserve a visual record of family activities, a
          vacation, or a special event, and intended for viewing at home by family and friends. Originally, home movies
          were made
          on photographic film in formats that usually limited the movie-maker to about three minutes per roll of costly
          camera
          film. The vast majority of amateur film formats lacked audio, shooting silent film.

          The 1970s saw the advent of consumer camcorders that could record an hour or two of video on one relatively
          inexpensive
          videocassette which also had audio and did not need to be developed the way film did. This was followed by
          digital video
          cameras that recorded to flash memory, and most recently smartphones with video recording capability, made the
          creation
          of home movies easier and much more affordable to the average person.

          The technological boundaries between home-movie-making and professional movie-making are becoming increasingly
          blurred
          as prosumer equipment often offers features previously only available on professional equipment.

          Shooting video
          When shooting please do not provide on-camera commentary or narration. This is to ensure that these videos can
          be used
          by similar articles in languages other than English.

          The style of these videos are intended to be simple and clean. No quick zooms or handheld walk throughs. Any
          movement
          within the frame (panning, tilting, or zooming) should be done slowly so that the viewer is able to focus on
          the detail
          of the images. Try and get a reasonable balance between shots with and without movement.

          If you are recording a shot with no camera movement or zoom, do not record for less than 5 seconds. If you are
          zooming,
          be sure to record 3 seconds before the zoom and wait at least 3 seconds after you reach the end of the shot.
          The same
          guidelines for zoom shots also applies to any shot that has movement (panning or tilting). Buffers will help
          with the
          editing of the video.

          Editing video
          Using editing software like iMovie or OpenShot (see List of video editing software for more options), import
          the video
          onto your computer to edit. Refer to instruction manuals for your specific software and camera to learn how to
          import
          and edit.

          In the editing process of multi-shot videos, think about opening your video with a shot that helps to
          establish the
          location of the site (e.g.: the opening shot in the Grand Central Terminal video is of the front of the
          building with
          surrounding buildings).

          Do not include narration, titles, transitions, special effects (with the exception of image control effects).
          The reason
          for this is twofold: one, to support the eventual possibility of online editing, where the inclusion of
          transitions and
          special effects would make re-editing difficult. Two, as stated previously, narration will render the video
          incompatible
          with the same article written in another language. Eventually online video editing will allow the overlay of
          effects and
          narration without changing the source video.

          This initiative is promoting an encyclopedic brand of video that helps to establish the very basics of the
          subject, and
          this can be reflected in the editing (e.g., the opening shot in the Grand Central Terminal video is of the
          front of the
          building with surrounding buildings).

          When finished, export your video. When exporting, be sure to select any options that support web streaming.

          Analog video
          See also: Analog television and Videotape

          Analog video signal from a Sony PlayStation
          Video technology was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode
          ray tube
          (CRT) television systems, but several new technologies for video display devices have since been invented.
          Video was
          originally exclusively a live technology. Charles Ginsburg led an Ampex research team developing one of the
          first
          practical video tape recorders (VTR). In 1951 the first VTR captured live images from television cameras by
          writing the
          camera's electrical signal onto magnetic videotape.

          Video recorders were sold for US$50,000 in 1956, and videotapes cost US$300 per one-hour reel.[2] However,
          prices
          gradually dropped over the years; in 1971, Sony began selling videocassette recorder (VCR) decks and tapes
          into the
          consumer market.[3]

          Digital video
          Main article: Digital video
          See also: Digital television and Video coding format
          The use of digital techniques in video created digital video. It could not initially compete with analog
          video, due to
          early digital uncompressed video requiring impractically high bitrates. Practical digital video was made
          possible with
          discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding,[4] a lossy compression process developed in the early 1970s.[5][6][7]
          DCT coding
          was adapted into motion-compensated DCT video compression in the late 1980s, starting with H.261,[4] the first
          practical
          digital video coding standard.[8]

          Digital video was later capable of higher quality and, eventually, much lower cost than earlier analog
          technology. After
          the invention of the DVD in 1997, and later the Blu-ray Disc in 2006, sales of videotape and recording
          equipment
          plummeted. Advances in computer technology allows even inexpensive personal computers and smartphones to
          capture, store,
          edit and transmit digital video, further reducing the cost of video production, allowing program-makers and
          broadcasters
          to move to tapeless production. The advent of digital broadcasting and the subsequent digital television
          transition is
          in the process of relegating analog video to the status of a legacy technology in most parts of the world. As
          of 2015,
          with the increasing use of high-resolution video cameras with improved dynamic range and color gamuts, and
          high-dynamic-range digital intermediate data formats with improved color depth, modern digital video
          technology is
          converging with digital film technology.
